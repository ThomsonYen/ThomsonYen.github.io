Hey!

I'm a Ph.D. student at Columbia University, where I think about machine learning with the amazing [Hongseok Namkoong](https://hsnamkoong.github.io/).
Particularly, I’m interested in scaling RL environments for LLM, teaching models to solve long-horizon ambiguous tasks ($$\neg$$ RLVR),  continual learning, and the associated memory methodology.

I obtained a Master’s in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University.
I had a great time studying distribution shift and machine learning at large, all thanks to working with incredible people like [Saurabh Garg](https://saurabhgarg1996.github.io/) and [Zachary Lipton](https://www.zacharylipton.com/).

Previously, I was a physics enthusiast at University of Toronto, who failed to understand Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and General Relativity (GR).
While failing, I was fortunate enough to work with the inspiring [Artur Izmaylov](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~aizmaylov/index.html) on quantum computing.
I’ve postponed understanding QFT and GR, but please catch and teach me if you do.

Outside of productive hours, I enjoy spending time with friends :)
